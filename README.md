# Smart Dictionary

## Project Summary
Smart Dictionary is a mobile application designed to help foreigners enhance their learning Korean experience through the integration of LLM. By entering the word, users are provided with comprehensive data that includes the word's definition, usage in a sentence, generated words including synonyms, antonyms, and a visually generated image related to the word. This multifaceted approach not only boosts vocabulary acquisition but also aids in reinforcing the learning contextually and visually.

## Purpose and Value Proposition
The application aims to drastically improve the way users learn and interact with new vocabulary. By integrating generative AI, SmartDict provides a holistic educational tool that is not only intuitive but also aligned with modern learning methodologies. The app ensures that outputs are closely related to the input word, thereby maximizing relevance and learning potential. This is achieved through prompt engineering, central to providing precise and useful outputs that
cater to the users' educational needs.

## Target Audience
- Language learners across various proficiency levels seeking to expand
their vocabulary.
- Educators and students in academic settings.
- Professional writers and communicators need to refine their word choice
and understanding.
